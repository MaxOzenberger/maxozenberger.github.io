# Esri FedGIS 2023 Exp Builder COP Demo

You will need access to the runtime portal in order to access the webmap embedded into the ExpBuilder. Contact me for a demo or get access from Kerry Robinson.

The custom widget can be found at ./client/your-extensions/widgets/listen-selection-change

Purpose was to look for any new reports and highlight that most recent report inside of the COP in an interactive way.

To start, ensure that you have NodeJS installed and accessible via CMD, then in an admin CMD cd to server directory and run "npm ci" and once completed run "npm start"
Repeat for client directory. You will then find it hosted on your localhost:3001
